 * Portable internet address structure.

 * The host must be specified in network byte-order, and the port must be in host
 * byte-order. The constant ENET_HOST_ANY may be used to specify the default
 * server host. The constant ENET_HOST_BROADCAST may be used to specify the
 * broadcast address (255.255.255.255).  This makes sense for enet_host_connect,
 * but not for enet_host_create.  Once a server responds to a broadcast, the
 * address is updated from ENET_HOST_BROADCAST to the server's actual IP address.
